# Prediction-of-Values-by-SVM
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning model that comprises a group of algorthims used for analyzing large volumes of data through classification and regression methods
A set of values is provided as an imput to the model which thereby analyzes the imput to predict, for each input, the class that forms the output. In this project, SVM model is used to classify the predicted values in specific categories.
